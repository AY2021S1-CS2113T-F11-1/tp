## 3. Design
This section provides a high level overview of our application, The Schwarzenegger.
### 3.1. Architecture

![Architecture]
The image above explains the design of the application, The Schwarzenegger. 

The main driver of the application is `Main: Duke`. It is responsible for mainly two phases:
- At application launch
    - This class will initialise the components in the correct sequence and is in charge of connecting them with each other.
- At shut down
    - This class will invoke cleanup method for the components when necessary.
    
In addition to that, the architecture of The Schwarzenegger is broken down into several packages, mainly the following: 
- `Ui`: This class mainly handles the UI of the application.
- `Parser`: This class mainly handles the parsing and handling of user commands.
- `Command`: This class handles the type of command.
- `Profile`: This class manages the data of the user.
- `Diet`: This class manages the meal recording sessions.
- `Workout`: This class manages the data workout recording sessions.
- `Storage`: This class reads data from and writes data back into a text file for future uses.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.2. Ui Component
![Ui Component](images/UI_Component.png)

API: `Ui.java`
 
The `Ui` package is a combination class where all interaction will be made through this component
 
The `Ui` component,

* Takes in user input
* Prints out response messages

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.3. Logic Component

![Logic Component](images/logic_update.png)

1. `The Schwarzenegger` uses `Parser` classes to parse the user command.
2. This splits the user input into interpretable portions by other functions.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.4. Model Component

![Model Component](images/model.png)

The Model component contains `Ingredient`, `Recipe` and `Chore` classes, which store the user's input in Kitchen Helper.
* Ingredient: Stores the ingredient data.
* Recipe: Stores the recipe data.
* Chore: Stores the chore data.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.5. Storage Component

![Storage Class Diagram](images/Storage.png)

Profiles, Diet sessions and workout sessions are stored in separate folders. 

The Storage package contains subpackages for profile, diet manager and workout manager.

The readDietSession() method in storage.diet package is used for loading saved diet sessions, which are loaded when the user wants to edit a past meal session.
readPastRecords() and readFileContents() methods in storage.workout package are used for loading saved workout managers and workout sessions respectively. It is called when the user accesses the workout manager.
loadData() from storage.profile is used to load user profile data and is called when the program starts up. 

The writeToStorageDietSession() method in storage.diet package saves the meal session and is called when the user exits it.
writePastRecords() and writeToStorage() methods in storage.workout package are used to save the workout managers and workout sessions respectively. It is called when the user exists the workout manager.
saveData() method in storage.profile is called when the user creates the user profile or edits it.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

### 3.6. Common Classes 
Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.duke` and the `ui` package, specifically Constant.java and CommonUi.java.

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

## 4. Implementation
This section describes some details on how the features are being implemented. All profile / diet / workout-related features.


All profile/ diet/ workout-related features can be broken down into 4 distinct functionality, addition, viewing/ listing, deletion and editing.
For diet and workout-realted features, there is an additional functionality of searching.

### 4.1. Main Menu-related Features

####4.1.1. Help Command for Main Page

The help command allows users to view all the available commands in the main page.
The command for help is `help`.

####4.1.2. Redirection to profile manager

The redirection to profile page allows the user to enter profile manager to create, edit, list and delete user profile.
The command for this redirection is `profile`.

####4.1.3. Redirection to diet manager

The redirection to profile page allows the user to enter diet manager to create, edit, list and delete diet sessions.
The command for this redirection is `diet`.

####4.1.4. Redirection to workout manager

The redirection to profile page allows the user to enter workout manager to create, edit, list and delete workout sessions.
The command for this redirection is `workout`.

### 4.2. Profile-related Features
#### 4.2.1. Creation of Profile

User can create a new profile. 
The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command format. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 
If the creation is successful, a confirmation message on the newly created profile will be displayed to the user. 

##### Implementation

When the user attempts to create a new profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, 
Command and CommandResult class will be accessed, and the following sequence of 
actions is called to return a command object AddProfile.

1. User executes `add /n Schwarzenegger /a 30 /h 188 /w 113 /e 100`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    2. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input.
    1. `ProfileParser.parseCommand` calls `ProfileParser.splitCommandWordAndArgs()` to split user input into string array.
1. Creation of Command object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` returns the correct Command Object `AddProfile`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `AddProfile.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `AddProfile` calls `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()` to parse the arguments to identify the tags.
    1. `AddProfile` creates and returns a new `Profile` Object with the parsed information.  
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `AddProfile.getCommandResult()` to get the `CommandResult` object.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `profileUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

##### Design considerations:
Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Userâ€™s command is split into size 2 array first
containing command type and command arguments. Then arguments are split
into command tag and information pairs.  

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Command tags do not have to follow a fixed order.|
|**Cons** | It takes multiple steps in parsing the command.|

- Alternative 2: Userâ€™s command is divided by space
                 
|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | The parsing can be easily done by calling Java built-in function .split(). Supports multiple tags or no tags.|
|**Cons** | Values for each variable cannot contain spaces which makes the application restrictive.|

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.2.2. Viewing Profile
The feature to view profile allows the user to view added profile
with calculated BMI based on height and weight.

##### Implementation
When the user attempts to view profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, 
Command and CommandResult class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `view`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    2. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input.
    1. `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` calls `ProfileParser.splitCommandWordAndArgs()` to split user input into string array.
1. Creation of Command object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` returns the correct Command Object `ViewProfile`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ViewProfile.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ViewProfile` returns the same `Profile` object.  
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ViewProfile.getCommandResult()` to get the `CommandResult` object.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `profileUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.
##### Design considerations:
Aspects: Status of stored data

- Alternative 1 (current choice): call public methods of Storage class to 
load the profile from hard disk every time the user wants to view profile.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Profile data is up-to-date if the user prefers to edit it in text file rather than using commands in The Schwarzenegger.|  
|**Cons** | Execution time is slow down due to loading the data.|

- Alternative 2: call public methods of Storage class to 
load the profile from hard disk when user enter Profile Menu.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Execution time is fast.|  
|**Cons** | Profile data is not updated in real time if user edits it in text file while running The Schwarzenegger.|

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)

#### 4.2.3. Editing of Profile
User can anytime go back to edit a profile created in the past such as
editing physique data.

##### Implementation
When the user attempts to edit a profile, the ProfileSession, Ui, ProfileParser, 
Command and CommandResult class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `edit /w 60`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    2. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input.
    1. `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` calls `ProfileParser.splitCommandWordAndArgs()` to split user input into string array.
1. Creation of command object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` returns the correct Command Object `EditProfile`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `EditProfile.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `EditProfile` calls `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()` to parse the arguments to identify the tags.
    1. `EditProfile` creates and returns a new `Profile` Object with the parsed information.  
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `EditProfile.getCommandResult()` to get the `CommandResult` object.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `profileUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

### 4.4. Workout-related Features
#### 4.4.1. Creation of new workout session

Users can create a new workout session The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command or IO related errors. The action will be aborted. If the creation is successful, the user will go into the new workout session to edit the exercises in that session.

The user can specify tags for the session. Creation time, last edit time and saving file name will be auto generated by the application and saved. 

##### Implementation

When the user attempts to create a new workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser 
and CommandLib class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called to return a command object NewWs.

1. User executes `new /t leg chest`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `NewWs`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `NewWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `NewWS` parse the arguments to identify the tags
    3. `NewWS` calls `WorkOutManagerStorage.add()` to create a new file to store information in this session. 
    If the creation fails, the action is aborted. Else, this record will be stored and the file path will 
    be returned.
    4. `NewWS` creates a new `WorkoutSession` Object with the file path. 
    5.  `NewWS` calls `workoutSession. workoutSessionStart()` so that user can add information into this session.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `ExecutionResult`.
1. Based on `ExecutionResult`, correct response will be be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating new workout session works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/NewWS.png)
##### Design considerations:
Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:  

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Userâ€™s command are divided by space

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | The parsing can be easily done by calling Java built-in function .split(). Supports multiple tags or no tags.|
|**Cons** | Values for each variable cannot contain spaces which makes the application restrictive.|

- Alternative 2: Multiple prompts for userâ€™s input of a recipe name and ingredient(s)

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Users would not have to make sure that their command is syntactically right.|  
|**Cons** | The constant prompting could subject the application to a negative experience in the difficulty to use the commands.|

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.4.2. Listing past workout sessions
The feature to list workoutSessions allows the user to view a summary of all the history 
workout sessions, including their index, creation date and tags.

##### Implementation
When the user attempts to list workoutSessions, the WorkoutManger, WorkoutManagerParse, ListWS and 
WorkoutManagerStorage class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `list`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ListWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `ListWS.execute()` to execute the command
    3. `NewWS` calls `WorkOutManagerStorage.list()`
    1. `WorkOutManagerStorage` will call Ui to print a formated table of the past records.
    6. `WorkoutManager` returns a `ExecutionResult`.
1. Based on `ExecutionResult`, correct response will be be printed to user.
##### Design considerations:
Aspects: Security of stored data

- Alternative 1 (current choice): call public methods of Storage class to 
print the list

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | pastRecord are private and it can only be manipulated through designed public methods. Only selected data will be printed and viewed.|  
|**Cons** | Most methods Storage needs to be a static.|

- Alternative 2: Storage return a readonly list of pastRecord.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | More versatile operations can be done.|  
|**Cons** | All data of pastRecord will be exposed.|

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.4.3. Editing of workout session
User can anytime go back to edit a workout session created in the past such as
adding or removing exercies in that session.

Each past workout session is stored in a different file name following its creation time.
The meta information of these past records such as file name, creation time are
stored in another file which will be loaded as the program initlises.
The actual workout session record will only be loaded if needed e.g. when editting is called. 

##### Implementation
When the user attempts to edit a past workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser, CommandLib
and WorkoutStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called.

1. User executes `edit 1`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `EditWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `EditWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    3. `EditWS` calls `WorkOutManagerStorage.edit()` to locate the file. If the does not exist, the action is aborted.
    Else, `WorkOutManagerStorage` updates the meta information of the file. The file path will be returned.
    4. `EditWS` creates a new `WorkoutSession` Object with the file path. `WorkoutSession` is initilised by loading the 
    data in the file.
    5.  `EditWS` calls `workoutSession.workoutSessionStart()` so that user start editing this session.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `ExecutionResult`.
1. Based on `ExecutionResult`, correct response will be be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

The sequence diagram below summarizes how editting past record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/EditWS.png)
##### Design considerations:
Past record storage and model design:  

- Alternative 1 (current choice): store past workout sessions in different files and their 
meta information in a separate file

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Initialization will be faster as data loaded grows little even in long terms.|
|**Cons** | Deleting files and creating files need to handle file names carefully.|

- Alternative 2: Load all past records during initilization

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Run time can retrieve data faster as there is no need to access data in hard disk.|  
|**Cons** | The application initialization will grow quickly as the application scales.|

[&#8593; Return to Top](#developer-guide)
#### 4.4.4. Deletion of workout session
User can delete a workout session created in the past by giving its index.

Each past workout session is stored in a different file name following its creation time.
The meta information of these past records such as file name, creation time are
stored in another file which will be loaded as the program initlises.
When the user tries to delete a file, the application refers to the meta information of the file to locate the
file and delete it. Then the meta information of the record will be deleted.

User can clear all data by iteratively delete the record until the meta data file is empty. To simplify that,
user can use `clear` command to achieve that.

##### Implementation

When the user attempts to delete a past workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser, CommandLib
and WorkoutStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of actions are called.

1. User executes `delete 1` or `clear`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `DeleteWS`
     or `clearWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `DeleteWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    3. `DeleteWS` calls `WorkOutManagerStorage.delete()` to locate the file. If the does not exist, the action is aborted.
    Else, `WorkOutManagerStorage` remove the meta information of the file and delete the record file.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `ExecutionResult`.
1. Based on `ExecutionResult`, correct response will be be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

##### Design considerations:

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Delete `workoutSession` by specifying index of it.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Quick and easy deletion by using ArrayList.get().|
|**Cons** | DLesser alternatives for the user and user would have to identify the index first by executing `list` to get index of the session to be deleted.|

- Alternative 2: Delete `workoutSession` by specifying `workoutSession` tags or dates.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | More alteratives for users. Can bulk delete files with certain attributes|  
|**Cons** | Tags and dates does not uniquely identify the record hence may result in accidental wrong deletion|
#### 4.4.5. Search based on conditions
The feature `search` allows the user to view a summary of all the history 
workout sessions which satisfies certain conditions.

The user can search by the date of creation or the tags that the session has. User can put in 0
or 1 or 2 criteria during search. 

##### Implementation
Format: `search /t <tag1> <tag2> /d <date>`

The user can attach variable number of tags after `/t` and one date after `/d`. The date must be specified
in certain formats for it to be recognisable. Else, it will be treated as there is no date criteria given.
[See here](#appendix-g-supported-formats-of-date-input) for all supported formats.

The tag criterion selects sessions which contains all the tags that the user specified in the search.
The date criterion selects the sessions which is created on that date. Only sessoins that satisfies all condtions 
will be selected and displayed.

The result is displayed in a table with the index of the selected records so that users can easily 
do further operations on them, e.g. `delete` or `edit`.
 
When the user attempts to list workoutSessions, the WorkoutManger, DeleteWS, WorkoutManagerStorage and 
WorkoutManagerParse class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `search /t leg /d 20201017`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `SearchWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `SearchWS.execute()` to execute the command
    3. `SearchWS` calls `WorkOutManagerStorage.search()`
    1. `WorkOutManagerStorage` will call `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` to parse the arguments into
    an array of predicates
    1. `WorkOutManagerStorage` filters the pastRecord arraylist and print out the ones
    which satisfy the predication.
    6. `WorkoutManager` returns a `ExecutionResult`.
1. Based on `ExecutionResult`, correct response will be be printed to user.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how searching record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/SearchWS.png)
##### Design considerations:
Aspects: indexing the selected results

The index of an record is not stored in the schema because it easily varies with 
addition and deletion. Thus given a record, searching for its index will have higher
time complexity.

- Alternative 1 (current choice): print out the actual index of the record 
in the meta info file.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | The index is useful for user to use for future actions.|  
|**Cons** | Checking for the actual location complicates the search time complexity.|

- Alternative 2: print out the index of the element in the result list.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Easy to implement. Low time complexity|  
|**Cons** | Since the index in result list is not the same as the index in actual record meta, user cannot use the index for further actions|

### 4.5. Recommendations
#### 4.5.1. Display Expenditure
The feature for displayexpenditure allows the user to keep track of their total expenditure and the amount they used in their cooking each week.

##### Implementation  
When the user attempts to display `expenditure`, the `Kitchen Helper`, `Parser` and `DisplayExpenditureCommand` class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:
1. The user keyed in `displayexpenditure`.
    1. A `UI` object will be created and calls `UI#getUserCommand()`. 
    1. Input will be parsed in `Parser#parseUserCommand()` and identified with the keyword `displayexpenditure`.   
2. Parsing of user input and creation of command object
    1. This will automatically trigger the parsing of the userâ€™s input string in `Parser#prepareDisplayExpenditure()` to ensure the parameters are empty, or an exception will be thrown.
    1. The `DisplayExpenditureCommand` object will be created. 
3. Executing Command
    1. The newly created object will call `DisplayExpenditureCommand#execute()` which will format the expenditure information into how it will be displayed.
    1. Lastly, a String called `feedbackToUser` containing the information to display will be returned to `KitchenHelper`. 
4. The expenditure information will then be printed onto the console using `Ui#showResultToUser(result)`.

##### Design considerations:

- Alternative 1(current implementation): Create a class to handle display of expenditure.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | More OOP. `displayexpenditure` is a supported user command so it should have its own class for its specific function just like other commands. |
|**Cons** | Very abstract method and a lot of effort in order to print the value of two variables.|

- Alternative 2: Have a method to display expenditure in `Parser` class.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Simpler and more basic implementation.|  
|**Cons** | Less OOP and will ruin the code style because its execution would be different from other commands. | 

    
#### 4.5.2. Expenditure functionality
The Expenditure function mainly keeps track of two variables, `totalExpenditure` and `amountUsedInCooking`. Total expenditure is the amount spent on purchase of ingredients for the week. Amount used in cooking indicates the price of all the ingredients used for cooking or consumption in the week. The latter variable reflects the extent to which the user makes use of his purchase and hence the amount of expenditure he benefited from.

##### Implementation  
The values of the variables in Expenditure change in the the following situations:

+ The user executes `addingredient`.  
    1. During the execution of `Parser#prepareAddIngredient`, `Expenditure#addToExpenditure` retrieves the price and quantity values of the ingredient being added. 
    1. `totalExpenditure` value increases by the value calculated by `Expenditure#addToExpenditure`. 
    1. `Storage#saveExpenditureData` saves the updated value.  
+ The user executes `cookrecipe`.
    1. During the execution of `CookRecipeCommand#checkIfIngredientExpired`, `Expenditure#addAmountForCooking` retrieves the quantity used in cooking for each ingredient in the recipe. 
    2. `amountUsedInCooking` value increases by the value calculated by `Expenditure#addAmountForCooking`.
    1. `Storage#saveExpenditureData` saves the updated value.  
+ The user executes `deleteingredient`.
    1. During the execution of `DeleteIngredientCommand#updateNewQuantity` and `DeleteIngredientCommand#deleteIngredient`, `Expenditure#editExpenditure` retrieves the quantity of the ingredient to delete.
    1. `Expenditure#editExpenditure` first executes `Expenditure#removeFromExpenditure`, which prompts the user whether the user would like to deduct the cost of the ingredient being deleted from the total expenditure, in the case the user is deleting the ingredient due to wrong addition and would not like to count its cost in total expenditure.
    1. If the user responds with `yes`, the `totalExpenditure` value is decreased by the amount calculated by `Expenditure#changePrice`.
    1. If the user responds with `no`, `Expenditure#editExpenditure` will then execute `Expenditure#addToAmountUsed`, which prompts the user whether the user would like to add the cost of the ingredient being deleted to the amount used in cooking, in the case the user manually deletes ingredients that have been cooked or consumed.
    1. If the user responds with `yes`, the `amountUsedInCooking` value increases by the amount calculated by `Expenditure#changePrice`.
    1. If the user responds with `no`, the `totalExpenditure` value and `amountUseInCooking` value remain unchanged.
    1. `Storage#saveExpenditureData` saves the updated value.


##### Design considerations:

Aspect: Singleton pattern for Expenditure class.

- Alternative 1(current implementation): Making Expenditure a Singleton.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | The Expenditure values are accumulated, so the exact same variables have to be used every time. Using only one instance of the Expenditure object allows that. |
|**Cons** | 1. Increases dependencies as it has a global state. It can be overused and be hard to track. <br> 2. Makes testing harder. |

- Alternative 2: Making Expenditure variables and methods static.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Static variables can also update expenditure using the exact same variables.|  
|**Cons** | Take up memory as they cannot be created and destroyed during program execution. |

- Alternative 3: Loading expenditure values from expenditure output text file to a local variable every time.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Also allows the retrieval of most updated value.|  
|**Cons** | A lot of storing and loading to and from text files, which increases overhead. |

Aspect: Storage of Expenditure data in its own output file.

- Alternative 1(current implementation): Storage in its own Expenditure output file.

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Neater to have a specific output file solely for Expenditure data. |
|**Cons** | Create an entire storage function and output file for three variables. |

- Alternative 2: Storage together with Chore data. 

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
|**Pros** | Does not require additional storage implementation and save space not creating another file. |
|**Cons** | Whenever save Expenditure data, the whole data file overwritten and need to loop through entire choreList to save Chore data with the new Expenditure data.|

### 4.6. Storage
Storage in the application refers to storing files of user profile and workout, diet sessions into respective local subdirectories sorted based on time in a local directory called /saves.
#### 4.6.1. Storage for profile

#### 4.6.2. Storage for diet
Storage for diet saves diet sessions created as individual files sorted based on the time created in the /saves/diet directory. Each diet session file is created as follows:
- Each file is created as a json file and named as `[date] [tag].json`.
- A corresponding file is updated in the local file when the user edits a diet session by calling DietSessionEdit.execute().
- A corresponding file is deleted in the local file when the user deletes a diet session by calling DietSessionDelete.execute() or clears all diet sessions by calling DietSessionClear.execute().

##### Implementation
Storage handles reading of file data by calling readDietSession() and overwriting of file data by calling writeToStorageDietSession().

#### 4.6.3. Storage for workout


### 4.7. Logging
Logging in the application refers to storing exceptions, warnings and messages that occur during the execution of Kitchen Helper. It was included to help developers to identify bugs and to simplify their debugging process. 

The `java.util.logging` package in Java is used for logging. The logging mechanism can be managed from the `SchwarzeneggerLogger` class through the `logger` attribute.

All control of the logger for the application can be viewed/ altered in the `initSchwarzeneggerLogger()` method. The current settings for the logger are as follow:

- All information is logged into a log file, `SchwarzeneggerLogs.log`.
- Logging is made to be displayed in the `SimpleFormatter` style where the date, class and error description are logged.

Logging Levels:
- `Level.SEVERE`: a serious failure, which prevents normal execution of the program, for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.WARNING`: a potential problem, for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.INFO`: reasonably significant informational message for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.CONFIG`: hardware configuration, such as CPU type.
- `Level.FINE`, `Level.FINER`, `Level.FINEST`: three levels used for providing tracing information for the software developers.

Additional logging can be done by adding the calling of the global logger and invoking the function `log()`. This will ensure that all loggings will be made to the same file across the various classes. 

An example is shown below:

```
public static final Logger logger = SchwarzenggerLogger.logger;
logger.log(Level.WARNING, description_of_warning_here, e.toString());
```
